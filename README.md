## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

I needed to build a to do list using the base full stack tools I have learned so far. First, I sourced different files using HTML to create a structure for my website. Then I could make the input fields and buttons come to life using event listeners and logic. With this active environment I could then render and manipulate things to the DOM and pretty up with CSS. Using all of this data I could send things back and forth through a server which were connected to a database stored on my laptop. To be more specific I allowed a user to create tasks which were added to a database, these tasks are shown on the website after creation. These tasks could either be completed or deleted which would also be stored in the database.
